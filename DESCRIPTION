Description: Implement exact and approximate balancing methods for causal generalization 
  based on the work of Chen, Chen and Yu (2023) and Chen, Chen and Yu (2025+). 
  The key idea is that for causal generalization, differences in the distributions of 
  treatment effect modifiers  between these populations, known as covariate shift, 
  can lead to varying ATEs. Our methods use only summary-level information from a target 
  sample while accounting for the possible covariate shifts.
